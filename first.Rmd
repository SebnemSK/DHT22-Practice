## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r my_code_chunk, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
norm <- rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
norm
```

Here's how the raw data looks:

```{r raw_data}
mtcars
```

Here' a better formatted version:

```{r cute_df}
knitr::kable(mtcars, digits = 2)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(norm)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
